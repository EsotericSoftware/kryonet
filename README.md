## Overview

KryoNet is a Java library that provides a clean and simple API for efficient TCP and UDP client/server network communication using NIO. KryoNet uses the [Kryo serialization library](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) to automatically and efficiently transfer object graphs across the network.

KryoNet runs on both the desktop and on [Android](http://www.android.com/).

KryoNet is ideal for any client/server application. It is very efficient, so is especially good for games. KryoNet can also be useful for inter-process communication.
